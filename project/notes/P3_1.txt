Image(imgId: int, iname: varchar(250), date: timestamp, url: varchar(250));
Album(aid: int, title: varchar(250), created: datetime, modified: datetime);
InAlbum(aid: int, imgId: int, caption: varchar(250), seqNum: int);

For my database, I decided to create three tables: an Image table, an Album table, and an InAlbum table. I included these tables so that I could add the information for the images including their url on the server, create an album and specify its details, and connect the images to a specific album using the InAlbum table. For the Image table, I created an imgId that would allow me to make each photo I enter unique. I then have a column for the name of the photo and a date column  that gives me a timestamp of when the photo was created. I included the url of the picture in the table so that when I display the table info in my website, that I can use the url in the <img src=ÓÕ portion and put the saved url into the ÒÓ part of the image tag so that it will display the picture. For my Album table, I added an aid column so that each album would be unique and created a title column so that I could enter the title of each Album. I also made created and modified columns so that I could record the date that the Album was created and the date it was modified. I did not include a modified column for the Images table since the Album, the images, will ever get edited. Therefore, the Image table only needs one that will record when it was created. Instead of having each ablum in table Album contain the individual names of the images and imagesÕ urls in that single table, I separated the Album from the images in it and instead linked the two together using the InAlbum table. For the InAlbum table, I included the album id and the image id in separate columns so that when I entered an image id number and an album id number it would indicate that that image was in that specific album. I included a caption column so that I could write a description of the image when I displayed it. I did this in the InAlbum section instead of the Image table just in case I added the same image to two different albums and wanted to write a different description of the photo when it is in the different albums. I also added a seqNum table to record the sequence of the images that appear in each album so that the image will display the order the pictures were created.
